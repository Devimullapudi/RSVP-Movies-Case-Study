# RSVP-Movies-Case-Study
# Problem Introduction:
RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company which has produced many super-hit movies. They have usually released movies for the Indian audience but for their next project, they are planning to release a movie for the global audience in 2022.

The production company wants to plan their every move analytically based on data and have approached you for help with this new project. You have been provided with the data of the movies that have been released in the past three years. We have to analyse the data set and draw meaningful insights that can help them start their new project. 

# Data Set and Database Creation:
We should download the IMDb SQL script file given containing all the commands and data required for the database creation using the Excel sheet above. We can run this script to load the data on the MySQL workbench and start with the querying exercises on the database.
